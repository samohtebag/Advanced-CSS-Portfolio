### Gabe Thomas's Porfolio

<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description

This is my porfolio for those who want to know more about me, view some of my highlighted projects, and get in contact with me for any opportunities!

The site displays all basic information about me, including a short bio, some of my work displayed, contact information, and a link to my resume.

The site is also responsive to different screen sizes.

Desktop screen:

![fullscreen](./Advanced-CSS-Portfolio/assets/fullscreen.png?raw=true  "Fullscreen View")

Mobile View:
