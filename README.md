### Gabe Thomas's Porfolio

<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description

This is my porfolio for those who want to know more about me, view some of my highlighted projects, and get in contact with me for any opportunities!

The site displays all basic information about me, including a short bio, some of my work displayed, contact information, and a link to my resume.

The site is also responsive to different screen sizes.

## 3. Navigation

Each of the items on the navigation bar anchors to the specific sections of the page. I've also included my resume which is downloadable when clicked.

The site was also created to be accessible to screen readers as best as possible.
